            <p class="about-items">I am a Computer Science student at the University of Ottawa. As a Computer Science student, I have some background knowledge when it comes to programming other computer science concepts.
                I've also learned how to communicate in multiple situations; from serving customers to technical troubleshooting for company staff. 
                Not only that, my recent experiences as an enterprise architect allow me to see software systems from a more macro level view.
                Overall, I think these experiences would make me a great candidate for you.</p>
